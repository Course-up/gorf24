  THE GIANTS' SHOULDERS
**************************
I wrote the current version of gorf24 entirely from
scratch, mostly based on the following sources:

* spidev documentation:    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/spi/spidev>
* RPi gpio tutorial:       <https://sites.google.com/site/semilleroadt/raspberry-pi-tutorials/gpio>
* nRF24L01+ specification: <http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/2.4GHz-RF/nRF24L01P>

Early versions of gorf24 dynamically liked to the RF24
library for Raspberry Pi by Stanley Seow. Some of the
comments in the code pointed me in the right direction,
most notably with regards to timing.

Seow's work is stronly derived from maniacbug's original RF24 library.
Much kudos to maniacbug for the great work.
