***************************
ADD /USR/LOCAL/LIB LDCONFIG
***************************

On Arch ARM for RPi, /usr/local/lib had to be added to ld.so.conf in order for golang to find the librf24*.so files at runtime.
you can check if the librf shared objects are detected by running:

$> ldconfig -v | grep librf

If the result is empty, then you need to add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf so that the golang runtime will detect the librf libraries.
NOTE: despite the "include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf" line in /etc/ld.so.conf, adding such a file had no effect. Needed to add directly to
ld.so.conf!

### 1. Open /etc/ld.so.conf with a text editor:
$> sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf

### 2. Add the line "/usr/local/lib"

### 3. Run ldconfig to update
$> sudo ldconfig

### 4. Verify detection of librf* shared objects using ldconfig
$> ldconfig -v | grep rf
   	    librf24.so.1 -> librf24.so.1.0
	    librf24_c.so -> librf24_c.so
